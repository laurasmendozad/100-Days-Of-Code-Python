<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Portrait de la jeune fille en feu</h3>
<p>This movie is so peaceful that I love it, 
    and the representation of the mith of Orfeo 
    and Euridice, it's simply marvelous.</p>

<h3>American Beauty</h3>
<p>Weird but so beautiful, the way that simple 
    things in life can be so gorgeous.</p>

<h3>Carol</h3>
<p>I repeat this movie so many times, is so perfect, 
    the soundtrack is magnificent.</p>
